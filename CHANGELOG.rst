  insensitive.
- Added a ``--recreate`` option to the ``fl nine-db-dotenv`` task.
- Added a ``noSplitting`` export to the Webpack library to easily disable the
  chunk splitting optimization. It may not be an optimization for projects

  ourselves instead.


`1.0.20220824`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220824: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220823...1.0.20220824

- Changed the ``output.assetModuleFilename`` configuration to do the right
  thing when encountering files outside Django's staticfiles.

  repeated ``fl pull-db`` invocations do not cause sign-outs when using Django
  4.0.


`1.0.20220615`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220615: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220411...1.0.20220615

  more control is required over the html-webpack-plugin configuration.
- Made the forwarding proxy optional in the ``devServer`` Webpack library
  utility.


`1.0.20220422.1`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220422.1: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220411...1.0.20220422.1

- Augmented ``fl nine-reinit-from`` to also support hosts with ``nine-manage-databases``.


`1.0.20220411`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``_old_dev`` utility so that going back to the old way of running the
  webpack development server is easier.
- Switched to a declarative setup.
- Avoided installing fabric 2.7.0 since some combinations of fabric and
  paramiko etc. seem to be buggy.


`1.0.20220405`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220405: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220324...1.0.20220405

- Made ``dev`` use the new method of using the Webpack dev server as a proxy
  for the Django backend instead of having to listen on two ports and
  comunicating IP addresses. The new method transparently works when connecting
  to the development server from a different IP.
- Updated the pre-commit configuration.
- Updated the ESLint configuration to assume an automatic JSX runtime.
- Removed outdated configuration file examples.
- Added a Webpack library to the files installed by ``fl hook``.
- Started syncing the repository URL on servers when deploying.

- Added yet another missing babel plugin.
- Reversed the default order of ESLint and prettier. ESLint doesn't complain
  about missing prettier formatting, and prettier can cleanup the results of
  ``eslint --fix``.
- Added a ``reset-sq`` task for resetting all PostgreSQL sequences in a
  database.
- Added ``python3.10`` and removed ``python3.7`` and ``python3.6`` from the
  list of Python 3 exexecutables used when initializing projects locally.
- Started initializing submodules in the ``update`` task. Using submodules for
  libraries is still discouraged. We use them so rarely that people forget how
  to do this.


`1.0.20220315`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220315: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220311...1.0.20220315

  warnings are shown even if ESLint doesn't find any errors.
- Added a missing babel dependency.

- Made ESLint automatically apply some fixes.
- Dropped a few legacy check methods; reimplement them in your own fabfile if
  you still need them (or better yet, move to pre-commit).
- Dropped the ``fmt`` task and all utilities. Use pre-commit instead.
- Updated our own pre-commit hooks.


`1.0.20220311`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220311: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220211...1.0.20220311

- Changed ``pull-db`` to create a local ``.env`` if it does not exist already.
- Restored the automatic installation of the pre-commit hook.
- Extended ``hook`` with a ``--force`` argument to allow overwriting
  pre-existing files in the project.
- Added ``.editorconfig`` and ``.eslintrc.js`` defaults to ``hook``. Updated
  the ``pre-commit`` configuration.


`1.0.20220211`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _1.0.20220211: https://github.com/feinheit/fh-fablib/compare/1.0.20220126...1.0.20220211

- Better defaults in the ``.env``: Add ``.localhost`` to the local
  ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting.
- Generate the standard ``SECURE_SSL_*`` settings instead of
  ``CANONICAL_DOMAIN*``.
- Changed force pushes to use ``--force-with-lease``.


`1.0.20220126`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``*jsx`` files to the gettext extractor.
- Tweaked the pre-commit configuration.


`1.0.20211124`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed ``fl check`` to build on ``pre-commit`` instead.


`1.0.20211029`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a configuration flag to always use force pushes for select
  environments.


`1.0.20210928`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added auto-updating of ``fl.require`` statements in projects.


`1.0.20210927`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``pyupgrade`` invocations to ``fl fmt``.
- Changed all ``_fmt_*`` utilities to not stop on errors.


`1.0.20210923`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``.feinheit.dev`` to the list of ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` in
  ``nine-db-dotenv``.

`1.0.20210816`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed the ``update`` task to not fail when running migrations fails. This
  allows ``fl update pull-db`` to continue.
- Added ``dist`` to the list of folders to skip when running ``makemessages``.


`1.0.20210705`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``--force`` to ``fl deploy`` to make ``git push`` use a force-push.
  This is especially useful to deploy e.g. staging branches which are rewound
  often.
- Added a ``SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=`` entry to generated ``.env`` files.


`1.0.20210506`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a ``pull_media`` task.
- Dropped ``--spec`` arguments from ``pipx run`` invocations. The temporary
  virtual environments will be cached for a maximum of 14 days anyway, so they
  should always be recent enough.


`1.0.20210424`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added an info message when the fh-fablib version is newer than the required
  version (so that projects' fabfiles are updated more often).


`1.0.20210423`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed ``_deploy_django`` (and therefore the default deployment) to use hard
  resets to update the code on the server instead of ff-only merges, but add an
  additional check for uncommitted changes right before resetting as a safety
  measure.


`1.0.20210202`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``config.environment`` holding the name of the active
  environment or ``"default"``.


`1.0.20210127`_

`1.0.20201221`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``fl hook`` to replace the git pre-commit hook.
- Corrected and updated the examples in the README.
- Changed ``fl github`` to terminate  with a better error message when
  the ``origin`` remote is already setup.


`1.0.20201215`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed ``nine-disable`` to backup and drop the database for real.
- Promoted ``_reset_passwords`` to ``reset-pw``.
- Removed the explicit activation of pip's 2020 resolver from pip
  invocations, it is the default now.
- Added ``nine-restart`` to restart the application server.
- Started executing nodejs binaries using ``npx``.
- Avoided pip 20.3.2 because it downloads too many packages.
- Added a ``--fast`` switch to ``deploy`` which skips Webpack.


`1.0.20201110`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Allowed setting the ``environments`` config key to produce nicer error
  messages when forgetting to set an environment with which to interact.


`1.0.20201029`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Started using pip's 2020 resolver when upgrading the virtualenv.
- Started terminating deploys when there are uncommitted changes on
  the server.


`1.0.20201005`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Started sourcing ``.profile`` again when running psql admin commands
  on the server.
- Fixed many problems with obviously untested ``nine-*`` tasks.


`1.0.20201004`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added ``github`` to create a repo on GitHub using the `GitHub CLI
  <https://cli.github.com/>__` and immediately push the code there.
- Fixed uses of ``input()`` which somehow didn't work like they were
  supposed to at all.


`1.0.20200924`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Renamed the entrypoint from ``fab`` to ``fl``.
- Switched from running ``pip`` directly to the recommended ``python -m
  pip`` everywhere.
- Avoided starting too many processes by executing binaries in
  ``node_modules/.bin`` directly instead of going through ``yarn run``.


`1.0.20200916`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made ``nine-venv`` recreate the virtualenv from scratch.
- Made ``local`` recreate ``node_modules`` and the virtualenv from
  scratch.


`1.0.20200915`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed ``nine-alias-remove`` to actually remove the second subdomain.
- Added a ``--include-www`` option to ``nine-alias-add`` and
  ``nine-alias-remove``. The ``www.`` subdomain isn't added or removed
  by default anymore.


`1.0.20200907`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed the redundant ``--trailing-comma es5`` argument to prettier,
  it is the default.
- Splitted ``_fmt_pipx_cmds`` into ``_fmt_isort`` and ``_fmt_black``.
- Reordered ``fmt`` to run Python tasks first, as ``check`` does.
- Extracted the branch check into its own ``_check_branch`` function.
- Changed ``nine-venv`` to prefer pyenv shims instead of the potentially
  outdated system-provided python3 binary.


`1.0.20200901`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added our own ``entry_points`` so that the ``--include-deps`` argument
  to ``pipx`` isn't necessary anymore.

- Stopped running ``flake8`` when formatting code.


`1.0.20200827`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added the ``--stable`` switch to ``upgrade`` to only install stable
  Python packages, no alpha, beta or rc versions.
- Disabled shortflags to ``dev``.
- Changed the default ``fmt`` implementation to run isort, black and
  flake8 via `pipx <https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/>`__. It is
  recommended you remove ``isort`` configuration from your project.
- Added default options when running prettier so that prettier
  configuration may be dropped from package.json (ES5 commas, no
  semicolons where not necessary).
- Changed ``check`` to run flake8 using pipx too.
- Inlined the ``dev`` and ``prod`` npm scripts.


`1.0.20200825`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Changed ``nine-db-dotenv`` to terminate when ``.env`` already exists
  on the server.
